# SpeedType

I happen to enjoy timed typing tests, and frequently find myself openning a new tab to visit speedtyping websites during the dull moments of life. There's nothing like the thrill of focusing your mind on a single pursuit. One that is both utterly simplistic, and yet also astoundingly complex. Feeling the intentional and symphonic orchestration as your hands strike the keys in a balance of both speed and precision is astoundingly rewarding. 


So, while this project may appear to be an irregularity in relation to my usual interests, I can assure you it is in fact, more of a culmination of numerous longstanding passions. It is with great ardor that I continue to build my dream webpage that is capable of fully imagining my enjoyment for this art.
